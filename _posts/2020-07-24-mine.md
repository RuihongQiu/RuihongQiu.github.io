Explanation of Mutual Infomation Neural Estimation, ICML 2018.

Mutual Infomation Neural Estimation
======
Mutual information is everywhere among top conferences, especially after tons of self-supervised learning paper.

Let's begin with the first big-hit paper, [Mutual Information Neural Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04062), in ICML2018.
