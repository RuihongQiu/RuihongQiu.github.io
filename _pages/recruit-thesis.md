I am actively looking for self-motivated students with general interest in data science and machine learning within UQ. Please visit <a href="https://student.eait.uq.edu.au/projects/?semester_id%5B%5D=7520&school_id%5B%5D=itee&q=&sendButton=" target="_blank"> Project Database</a> for my available projects.

These projects are primarily intended for students who are **committed to pursuing a PhD** after their coursework studies (not necessarily within my group). Gaining pre-PhD research experience at a PhD-level standard for six months or even longer provides a significantly higher chance of securing a PhD position afterwards.

**For UQ's master/undergraduate students**

UQ master/bachelor programs have (Type 1) thesis project, capstone projects and honours project (with 6 or 8 units for one year) and (Type 2) summer/winter/internship project (no unit). These projects can be towards research paper/cross-disciplinary project. If you want to have **research outcome such as a paper**, please consider doing **both a Type 2 project and then a Type 1 project** with me. 
  
Students are expected to have either (1) a high GPA in math, algorithm, ML/DL/DM courses at UQ; or (2) finish **videos, lecure notes, assignments, codings, and extended reading** of any/multiple in the following: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU" target="_blank"> CS229 (ML)</a>ï¼Œ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOmsNzYBMe0gJY2XS8AQg16" target="_blank"> CS231n (DL&CV)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOaMFbaqxPDoLWjDaRAdP9D" target="_blank"> CS224n (NLP)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn" target="_blank"> CS224w (GNN)</a>, or <a href="https://stanford-cs336.github.io/" target="_blank"> CS336 (LLM)</a> from Stanford, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ" target="_blank"> RL course</a> from DeepMind&UCL, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfXxKgI1GgyV1B_Xa0DxE5eH" target="_blank"> CS285 (Deep RL)</a> from Berkeley.
