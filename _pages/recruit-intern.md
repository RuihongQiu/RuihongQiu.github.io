I am actively looking for self-motivated intern students interested in data science and machine learning, especially in graph neural networks, information retrieval, recommender systems, time series etc.

### Research interests:
1. **Graph Neural Networks**
  * Text-attributed graph and multimodal graph with (M)LLMs
  * Graph foundation models
  * Robustness and scalability of graph learning (OOD, test-time, condensation, distillation, graph-MLP etc.)
2. **Recommendations and Information Retrieval**
  * RL for recommendations
  * Rich side-information in recommendations with (M)LLMs
  * Domain-specific IR and document understanding with LLMs
3. **Time Series**
  * Foundation models for time series
  * LLMs for time series
  * Time series for cross-disciplinary applications

**For (remote) research interns or visitors**
  
  You must have ML/DL/DM background. Welcome to email me with a specific research plan for short-term work.

**Email me "r.last-name-lowwer-case@uq.edu.au":**
1. Email topic: "UQ CS Thesis Application by Your Name".
2. Please attach your CV, transcripts and a representative writing sample (paper/preprint) if any.
3. Please customize your email according to my research interest and be specific about your research interest, in several sentence.
